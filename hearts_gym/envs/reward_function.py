        It is important to keep in mind that most of the time, the
        arguments are unrelated to the player getting their reward. This
        is because agents receive their reward only when it is their
        next turn, not right after their turn. Due to this peculiarity,
        it is encouraged to use `self.game.prev_played_cards`,
        `self.game.prev_was_illegals`, and others.

                the action (which is given by `prev_active_player_index`).
            prev_active_player_index (int): Index of the previously
                active player that took the action. In other words, the
                active player index before the action was taken.
            trick_is_over (bool): Whether the action ended the trick.
